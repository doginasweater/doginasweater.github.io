<h1>Dog In A Sweater Tutorials</h1>

<p>
  This is a tutorial to take you from zero to competent using my 
  chosen set of development tools. Generally speaking, I'm a flexible .net 
  dev who does way too much front-end, so this will focus a lot on
  my favourite tools. The main focuses of this tutorial will be:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Bootstrap 4 - the utility classes it provides and the sass configuration it 
    allows have REALLY sold me on it again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Typescript - types are <strong>amazing</strong> and I won't hear you say otherwise.
    Also, I think tsc is way easier to configure than babel.
  </li>
  <li>
    React - react is COOL and also component architectures are nice.
  </li>
  <li>
    ASP.NET Core - C# is great, asp.net core is great, cross-platform is great. 
  </li>
</ol>
